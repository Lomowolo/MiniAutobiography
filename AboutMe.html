        <pre>
            My name is Cristian André Rodríguez Gelpi, my friends call me Gelpi. 

            I love programmig ever since I went to a cyber security camp in 12th grade, in that

            moment I knew I wanted to be a programmer. I've always used technology since I was 2

            with my grandmother showng me video games and have been my favorite pass time

            ever since. For the most part of my life I have been a shy person, smart, and I love to hang out with friends. 


            My passion in the programming world grew when I did a small sample

            website for a class, the desire to create websites started from there. I love to use technology,

            my interest grows each and every day to make websites for everyone. I also 

            enjoy going on trips, cruise ships if given the opportunity, would like

            to go to Italy and Japan in the far future.
